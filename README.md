## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
  
  
  /*    */ 
 first of all we declare variable so we can call them and make function also  
 then we create undordered list dynamically then we create button with loop so that we can Add more sections by clicking 


 create another button so that we can change our style by classList 

 After that we make function with event listener so that we can scroll by clicking and vice versa so we can return back 
  

  finally we make function so that to make every sections collapsible.
